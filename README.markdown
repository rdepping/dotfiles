# What is this?
These are Ralphs's shell configuration dotfiles. The goal is to increase CLI productivity on Linux (mainly Ubuntu) and OSX, though many scripts run just fine on any POSIX implementation.

# Focus
The focus is on Bash support.

# Inspirations
The contents of this repo are based on Matthew McCullough's original (https://github.com/matthewmccullough/dotfiles). Others have been created over the years and gathered here - such Jim Lawton's which is where I forked from.

# Acquiring This Repo
This project contains submodules. It is suggested that you clone this into your home directory.

    cd ~

> NOTE: Some personal configuration of Ralph's will remain after setup. You should fork and tweak to your specific needs.
