# What is this?
These are Jim's shell configuration dotfiles. The goal is to increase CLI productivity on Linux (mainly Ubuntu) and OSX, though many scripts run just fine on any POSIX implementation.

# Focus
The focus is on Bash support.

# Inspirations
The contents of this repo are based on Matthew McCullough's original (https://github.com/matthewmccullough/dotfiles). Others have been created over the years and gathered here.

# Acquiring This Repo
This project contains submodules. It is suggested that you clone this into your home directory.

    cd ~
    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/jimlawton/dotfiles .dotfiles

# Setup
There is a set up script that establishes the symlinks in your home directory. Run this once.

* For ZShell
        ~/dotfiles/_setupdotfiles.zsh
* For Bash (needs some fixes)
        ~/dotfiles/_setupdotfiles.bsh

> NOTE: Some of my personal configuration will remain after setup. You should fork and tweak to your specific needs.

# Non-automated, non-captured config

Reminder-to-self: Some additional personalization lives in the `~/.config/` directory.  Specifically, the `~/.config/gh/config.yml` file for [`gh`](https://cli.github.com). It is not yet in scope for capture or copy, but some users have [shared their configuration in a Gist](https://gist.github.com/vilmibm/a1b9a405ac0d5153c614c9c646e37d13).
